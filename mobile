"description": " Prepare your phone: PUBG Mobile is a demanding game and your phone needs to be at its best. Remove anything you don't need on it, quit all those other apps you might have running in the background. Turn off battery saver, turn off data savers, turn off night mode for the best experience. You will want to turn off auto-brightness  it might dim the screen during the game so you can't see so well. Brighter better. If you have a game mode, use it, as it will make your phone run better "

"description": " Prepare your network: There's not so much you can do here, but for a lag-free experience, you need a good connection to the PUBG servers. Test your network speed using something like Speedtest (Apple App Store, Google Play) and avoid trying to play when someone else is streaming 4K content  you might find playing on a 5G connection is better than your domestic Wi-Fi, so it's worth testing.

"description": " How to get clothes on your character: You start in your underwear, but you can accumulate clothes in your inventory. You can buy clothing with real money in the Shop, or you can unlock clothes as you play by earning BP and opening crates. Some clothes are temporary, some you get to keep. There are always clothes in the game to pick up as you play.  "
