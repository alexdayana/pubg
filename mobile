"description": " On PC and console leaning becomes second nature. Being able to stick your head out but keep the rest of your body safely behind cover makes it a lot harder to hit you, and is a core mechanic. But on mobile it can be harder to use this tactic as you’ll have to move your thumbs away from moving and aiming to do so. This does make it a little harder to use well, but with some practise you can master this and stop putting your whole body at risk "

"description": " Playing with sound is always going to be preferable, as it will allow you to hear what is going on in your vicinity but if that isn’t possible then there is another way to work out where those shots are coming from. The direction of any shots in your direction or those close to you will be shown on the mini map You can then spin to that position and unload a spray of bullets at whoever thought they had caught you off guard.

"description": " One of the ways that PUBG Mobile runs smoothly on lower end devices is to only render the grass and foliage close to the player, so that means if you think you are being a sneaky snake in the grass, you actually just look like a muppet crawling through a field to anyone with a  or better scope. Always stick to hard cover if possible. Crawling through the grass only really works in the very late game circles.   "

"description": " Sure some people may say auto-aim is for noobs but when it helps out this much there really is no reason to turn it off unless you want to go pro. The auto-aim on PUBG Mobile is crazy good at times, and you should assume that all your foes will be using it too. Make sure to keep this on, and you will barely ever miss a shot again.  "
